    Key Insight : for the ith temperature if we can find a jth temperature 
    while iterating from left to right such that ,
    j > i (means future day)
    temperatures[j] > temperatures[i] (warmer day)
    we can say we got solution for all the previous days 
    we can just find the days required by subtracting the (current day - prev day)


    we are going to store the indices (days) in the stack and whenever a warmer day in future comes 
    then we are going to find the difference between the current day and the previous days for the answers
